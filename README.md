# The Comic Book Library Project - Design Briefing

The Comic Book Library Project aims to create a modern interface to display comic book information. 
While there are a number of fantastic projects out there to collect information about comic books, none of them display the in an easy to browse and nice to look at fashion. 

This repository is merely a call for designs, not the actual project. It serves as a design briefing for interested people to submit their designs.

### How to submit

Please fork this repository (see https://help.github.com/en/articles/fork-a-repo), create a subfolder with your handle and submit a pull request with your designs. The design itself should be plain html/css


### The Wireframes

Please check the wireframes folder to see wireframes for the individual pages. The wireframes are for information design only and are not meant to be a blueprint for the visual design. So you are free to create your own visual design, as long as the majority of the information displayed on the wireframes are kept.
